# Data Scientist Jobs Project 

A 5-part project to understand the UK data scientist jobs market

I developed and practiced a broad range of python data analytics skills to get a better understanding of the UK data scientist jobs market:

1. Web scraping: using Selenium Webdriver, I scraped the details of job listings from glassdoor.co.uk
2. Data enrichment, cleaning and reduction: I filled gaps in the data set, cleaned it column-by-column, and reduced it to use less memory
3. Feature engineering: a text analysis of job descriptions to identify skills and tools mentioned by employers, added to the data set as additional features
4. Exploratory data analysis: I used NumPy, pandas and data visualisation libraries to get an overview of the data science jobs market
5. Hierarchical clustering: to understand which data science skills and tools might be related, I did an in-depth study of clustering categorical variables to group the skills and tools based on how frequently they are mentioned together in job listings
